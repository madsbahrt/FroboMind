FroboMind is a conceptual architecture for field robotics software. 
It provides the means of using the same generic architecture and 
components across different field robots and hereby maximizing efficiency, 
reliability, modularity, extendability and code reuse. FroboMind is open source 
and is implemented in ROS. This wiki contains the technical documentation for 
FroboMind and related projects.
